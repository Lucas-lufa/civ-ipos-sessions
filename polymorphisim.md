polymorphism 

Inheritance is where you take a class and make a new class out of it so it can be extended without rewriting it or copying and pasting it. In the example speak() in the Animal class gets passed to classes that inherit from it, even though it has not been defined.
 
 Polymorphism (poly many) (morph forms). To change from one to another, casting from one type to another is the most common form of this but there is also method overriding. 
 
 Method overriding is where the method identifier is inherited into a new class but the method's implementation is changed. This allows us to make one function that can act on all the class instances but produce something different.
